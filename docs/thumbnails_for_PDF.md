The storage module HSSM gives only file stream for file access.
When listing the PDFs in the front-end, PDF first page should be displayed as document thumbnail.

Currently a fixed image is used for thumbnail as temporary workaround. Need to implement actual code for extracting first page from PDF for thumbnail.
